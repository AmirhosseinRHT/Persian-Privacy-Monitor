You are given two inputs:

1. A canonical list of normalized entities (in Persian).
2. A JSON dataset describing websitesâ€™ data practices, where each category contains textual items in Persian or English.

Your task is to:
- For every item in the JSON, find the closest match from the canonical entity list.
- Replace the JSON item with the canonical form from the entity list.
- ** Important** : every value in data practices json must be exactly available in canonical list or be replaced with on of them.
- Do not add new items or remove existing ones. The JSON structure and the number of items must remain exactly the same.
- Only replace each phrase with its best matching normalized entity from the list.
- The output should be the updated JSON dataset with all items replaced by their canonical equivalents.
- If the text contains no relevant information about data practices, return exactly the same JSON below with empty arrays.
output format:
```json
{
    "collect": [],
    "save": [],
    "share": [],
    "not_collect": [],
    "not_save": [],
    "not_share": [],
    "cookie": []
}
```
Return only the final updated JSON.
