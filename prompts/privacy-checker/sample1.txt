You are given two types of information:

1. Cookies set by a website
2. The website's declared data practices in its privacy policy (already normalized into structured JSON)

Your task:
- Compare the cookies with the declared practices
- Identify privacy violations if any exist
- Each violation must be categorized into one or more of the following categories:
  - Undeclared Data Collection
  - Undeclared Data Sharing
  - Undeclared Data Storage
  - Inconsistent Retention
  - Excessive Scope
  - Third-party Tracking
  - Cross-site Tracking
  - Security Weakness

Output:
- Return a JSON object with:
  {
    "violations": [
      {
        "category": "...",
        "description": "...",
        "evidence": [ ...list of cookies or practices that caused the issue... ],
        "severity_score": 1-5
      }
    ]
  }

Rules:
- Always give at least an empty array if no violation is found.
- Severity scoring guideline:
  1 = negligible
  2 = low
  3 = moderate
  4 = high
  5 = critical
